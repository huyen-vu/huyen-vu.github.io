<p><b style="font-size:150%;"><em>As one is about to land at <b>Nha Trang </b>airport, he/she will be totally awed by the blue water of <mark>Nha Trang's beach </mark>. The Bay is among the world's top 10 and there are many affordable resorts and hotels ideal for long stay around the Bay. <b> Nha Trang</b> makes an excellent choice for both families and couples and promise a trip to remember.</em></p></b>
<p><b>Nha Trang Beach</b> is the most famous beach in Vietnam for both blissful nature and the touristy enthusiastic atmosphere.<strong>Nha Trang </strong>.nature is endowed with not only for the crystal-like waters and the pristinely white sand of Nha Trang's 6 km beach but also for the many idyllic surrounding islands, which will definitely guarantee you an exotic get-away from the bustling city. The rather peaceful yet energetic modern city brimming with tall green mountains in the background lie along the gently curved stretch of dazzling white sand . This perfect combination of human construction and natural beauty comes together with the amazingly clear water, colliding with the vast blue sky at the faraway horizon, which makes up the one of most spectacular settings of the country. Owing to the demand for tourism, the beachfront has gone under many makeovers for the past few years, with well looked after pretty parks, interestingly creative sculpture gardens and long lines of neatly prune trees rarely seen anywhere else spread along the shorefront. These parks and gardens serve as an ideal alternative to the beach as a place for a romantic long walk.</p>

</p>
<p><b style="font-size:150%;"><em>Hoi An is an old town down the Thu Bon River, on the coastal plain of <mark>Quang Nam Province </mark>, about 30 km south of Da Nang City . Hoi An used to be known on the international market with many different names such as Lam Ap, Faifo, Hoai Pho and Hoi An.</em></p></b>
<p>What is so special about <strong> Hoi An </strong>is that this little port town is in an incredible state of preservation. It offers some of the most densely-concentrated sights in <strong>Viet Nam </strong> with its old streets bordered with ancient houses and assembly halls, its pagodas, temples, ancient wells and tombs. In total, more than a thousand places of interest. The architecture of Hoi An is characterised by a harmonious blend of <i>Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese</i>. After many centuries, <strong>Hoi An </strong>is still respectful of its traditions, folk festivals, beliefs and of its sophisticated culinary art. Set in a quiet environment, Hoi An is surrounded by peaceful villages that have crafts such as <i>carpentry, bronze making, ceramic... </i>

Researchers said most of the buildings in <b>Hoi An </b>underwent restoration at the beginning of the 19th century, even if they might be constructed long time ago. The ancient architecture shown most clearly in the Ancient Town that located in Minh An Ward. It covers about 2 square kilometres and almost of all famous relics in <b>Hoi An</b> are gathered here. The streets are very short and narrow, having a winding, crossing as the chessboard style. The topography of the ancient town tilt gradually from north to south. The buildings in the old town is built mostly with traditional materials such as: <i>brick, wood </i>and no more than two floors. The traces of time is able to find not only on the architectural design of each building but also everywhere like: on the yin-yang roof tiles covered with moss and plants; the old gray mold walls; the pictures carved on a strange animal, or describing a old storyâ€¦ Having inherited a multi-cultural architecture so varied and sophisticated, Hoi An must have attracted numerous and talented workers in carpentry, ceramics, and woodcarving from China, Japan and other regions of <strong>Viet Nam </strong>. </p>
<p>
For centuries, <b>Hoi An</b> had developed into a melting pot of various nationalities who came to the area, bringing along their own cultures. Accordingly, <b>Hoi An </b>features the co-existence of indigenous customs and habits and those imported by foreign settlers.
