<P> As one is about to land at Nha Trang airport, he/she will be totally awed by the blue water of Nha Trang's beach. The Bay is among the world's top 10 and there are many affordable resorts and hotels ideal for long stay around the Bay. Nha Trang makes an excellent choice for both families and couples and promise a trip to remember.</p>
<p> Nha Trang Beach is the most famous beach in Vietnam for both blissful nature and the touristy enthusiastic atmosphere. Nha Trang nature is endowed with not only for the crystal-like waters and the pristinely white sand of Nha Trangâ€™s 6 km beach but also for the many idyllic surrounding islands, which will definitely guarantee you an exotic get-away from the bustling city. The rather peaceful yet energetic modern city brimming with tall green mountains in the background lie along the gently curved stretch of dazzling white sand . This perfect combination of human construction and natural beauty comes together with the amazingly clear water, colliding with the vast blue sky at the faraway horizon, which makes up the one of most spectacular settings of the country. Owing to the demand for tourism, the beachfront has gone under many makeovers for the past few years, with well looked after pretty parks, interestingly creative sculpture gardens and long lines of neatly prune trees rarely seen anywhere else spread along the shorefront. These parks and gardens serve as an ideal alternative to the beach as a place for a romantic long walk.</p>
